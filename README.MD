Chess board

Welcome to my project which will allow you to personalize your own chess board. Making the chess board was not easy as I've had restart that part many times till I got it right.

First the user will be asked which letter, symbol, or number he wants to include in his chess board and then the user will need to choose a size between 1 and 15. As the user enters a specific number the rows and columns of the character will go duplicate to that number maintaining the original chess board size.

To continue improving the chess board, I would also like to include a part where you can choose the colours of the board. 

I'm open for any improvements or ideas to make the chess board look better.

Thank you!
